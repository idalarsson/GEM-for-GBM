# GEM-for-GBM

This repo contains all scripts for reproducing the results presented in the paper "Genome-scale metabolic modelling of glioblastoma reveals promising targets for drug development", in revision in Frontiers in Genetics.

We also provide the RNAseq data set used in the manuscript to define the differentially expressed genes between high and low survival patients.
